# OpenDomination
This is an open source version of the popular RISK Global Domination game. I got the inspiration from [yura.net](http://domination.sourceforge.net/)'s version of the game, which is also [open source](https://sourceforge.net/p/domination/code).

This project is written with C# libraries and will feature some form of Onion Architecture. In the end there will be a webserver with an API, so multiple platforms can be connected for multiplayer games.
